This R project contains a workflow to conduct opioid overdose surveillance in the Leeds, Grenville & Lanark District
Health Unit (LGLDHU). At present time, our only data source is the Acute Care Enhanced Surveillance System (ACES) which
contains hospital data from the region. Specifically, it is syndromic surveillance data and incorporates hospital
records that have been classified as alcohol, toxicological, or opioid related using natural language processing (NLP)
methods on the chief complaints at ED.
