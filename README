This R project contains a workflow to conduct opioid overdose surveillance for the Leeds, Grenville & Lanark District Health Unit (LGLDHU). We use National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS) and Discharge Abstract Database (DAD) data to quantify the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to opioid overdoses. We use the ICD-10 T codes defined by Public Health Ontario (PHO) and we count with respect to hopsital PHU, not patient PHU.

This RProject can be run by entering targets::tar_make() into the console. If there are any errors, try entering targets::tar_destroy() and then targets::tar_make() into the console.
